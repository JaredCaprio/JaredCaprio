  <summary><h3>My Coding JourneyðŸ’»</h3></summary>
  From the early days of high school, where curiosity sparked my interest in the intricate world of coding, to my current endeavors as a self-taught programmer, my journey has been one of discovery and growth. It all began with a lingering fascination about the inner workings of websites, prompting me to enroll in an introductory Web design class during my high school years. With each line of HTML and CSS, I delved deeper into the art of crafting digital experiences.

Although my initial foray into coding didn't extend beyond that class, the allure of programming lingered in the recesses of my mind. A decade later, the resurging wave of self-taught programmers caught my attention, igniting a renewed passion within me. I embarked on a personal odyssey, determined to expand my knowledge and skills in the vast realm of programming.

Starting with humble beginnings, I ventured into developing small websites for my band, utilizing the power of HTML, CSS, and gradually incorporating the enchanting realm of JavaScript. Front-end and web development became my primary focus, capturing my imagination with its blend of creativity and technical finesse. Eager to stay at the forefront of innovation, I remain receptive to embracing new tools and technologies, constantly seeking to refine my craft.

At present, my ambitions have led me towards mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, an agile and comprehensive framework for building dynamic web applications. Simultaneously, I am engrossed in the realm of TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that offers enhanced static typing and improved developer experience.

Driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and a fervent desire to craft exceptional digital experiences, I continue to embark on my coding journey. With each new line of code, I strive to elevate the boundaries of what is possible, embracing challenges and seizing opportunities to evolve both as a programmer and as an individual.
